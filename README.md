Pymaceutical Challenge Assignment
- In this study, approximately 250 mice were tested with 10 different Drug Regimen. The lab subjects were evenly distributed and randomly selected among sex and weight. 
- Of these, Capomulin and Ramicane demonstrated the best results. They had the smallest Average Tumor Sizes (~40 vs the placebo's 54 mm3) and low Standard Deviation. In other words, they routinely shrunk the mice's tumors more than the competition. 
- It is important to note, there was a strong correlation (0.84) between the size of the tumors and weight of the mice tested with Capomulin. As we look to proceed to larger test subjects, we may need to revisit the proper dosage to ensure efficacy.
